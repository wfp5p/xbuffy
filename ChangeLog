Changed the apps-default file a little.

Added a error message if the mailbox could not be opened.

Allowed polltime to be zero.  This means no polling for the box.

Added support for using C-Client to check mailboxes (thanks to Tim Culver for
providing the original code).  This allows Xbuffy to know about a lot more 
mailbox formats including MMDF, IMAP, MH, MAILDIR, and others.

Button 3 will now reset the box colors.

The box name (if you are using boxfiles) can now contain environment variables.  
This is currently only done for the box parameter.  To use an environment 
variable, put it in {} (for example: box /usr/spool/{USER}

Now trys to look for lock files.  Right now it only knows about .lock .

Added the ability to use Content-Length: headers.

Options to center and/or make all boxes the same size (this the the -center and
-fill options).
